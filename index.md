                Testing for potential security vulnerabilities in modern applications is an
                important part of the software development lifecycle. Such security testing,
                however, can slow down the adoption of updates and can be very costly for
                organizations that have a lot of applications. On the other hand, neglecting
                security testing incurs serious risks that could result in the unavailability
                or interruption of business processes due to hackers exploiting an unnoticed
                vulnerability or launching a potential cyberattack.

                        A recent high-profile example of this is the REvil ransomware attack that
                        affected hundreds of organizations, where the initial vector was a deficiency
                        in the legitimate application Kaseya VSA. These types of attacks are called
                        supply-chain attacks and they use unknown vulnerabilities and misconfigurations	
                        to scale their attacks. The SolarWinds attack at the end of 2020 demonstrated
                        how advanced threats actors can misuse software supply-chains to gain a
                        significant foothold into the internal networks of even the biggest IT
                        organizations in the world.

                        The research project PeT-HMR aims to improve the state of automatization in vulnerability
                        research
                        to enable continuous security testing and to identify known and hidden vulnerabilities in
                        production
                        systems at scale, typically those that are not easily detected by conventional methods. In this
                        way,
                        improved security testing will become more available and efficient companies of all sizes.

                        Despite all these ever-changing and newly emerging
                        challenges, there is also a persistent shortage of security researchers, even
                        as development and deployment in cloud environments are still accelerating.
                        The PeT-HMR project, which started in June 2021, will research the potential of
                        a novel honeypot system designed to provide data and add attack patterns to an
                        automatic penetration testing solution (APeT). The APeT solution will use
                        Machine Learning and other AI methods to efficiently find new attack vectors
                        based on the collected data. In the first stage of the project, the focus is on
                        microservices, and in particular, on applications deployed in the cloud.
